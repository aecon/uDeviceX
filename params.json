{"name":"uDeviceX","tagline":"The In Silico Lab-On-A-Chip","body":"### Simulations running at 60% of the theoretical Peak Performance.\r\nWe a software for Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations of blood and cancer cell separation in complex microfluidic channels with subcellular resolution. The software is performing at 65.5% of the available 39.4 PetaInstructions/s in the 18'688 nodes of the Titan supercomputer.\r\n\r\n### Outperforming the LAMMPS GPU package and HOOMD-Blue. \r\nFor a shear layer flow problem, we demonstrate an speedup of up to 45X against the GPU package of LAMMPS solvers from 27 to 18'600 nodes. We report a 4X speedup against HOOMD-Blue, in the limited range of node supported by HOOMD-Blue (up to 280 nodes).\r\n\r\n### Rapid prototyping the next-generation of Lab-On-A-Chips\r\nThis simulations delivered by this software outperform by one to three orders of magnitude the current state-of-the-art in terms of numbers of simulated red blood cells and computational  elements. The software emulates the conditions and the geometric complexity of microfluidic experiments.  \r\nThese simulations provide sub-micron resolution while accessing time scales relevant to engineering designs.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
