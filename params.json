{"name":"uDeviceX","tagline":"The In Silico Lab-On-A-Chip","body":"### Running at 65% of Peak.\r\nThis is the software for Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations of blood and cancer cell separation in complex microfluidic channels with subcellular resolution. It relies on CUDA and MPI to run very efficiently on GPU-accelerated supercomputers. It is performing at 65.5% of the available 39.4 PetaInstructions/s in the 18'688 nodes of the Titan supercomputer.\r\n\r\n### Outperforming the competition by 45X. \r\nFor a shear layer flow problem, we demonstrate an speedup of up to 45X against the GPU package of LAMMPS solvers from 27 to 18'600 nodes. We report a 4X speedup against HOOMD-Blue, in the limited range of node supported by HOOMD-Blue (up to 280 nodes).\r\n\r\n### Devising the next-generation of Lab-On-A-Chips.\r\nThis simulations delivered by this software outperform by one to three orders of magnitude the current state-of-the-art in terms of numbers of simulated red blood cells and computational  elements. The software emulates the conditions and the geometric complexity of microfluidic experiments.  \r\nThese simulations provide sub-micron resolution while accessing time scales relevant to engineering designs.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
