{"name":"uDeviceX","tagline":"The In Silico Lab-On-A-Chip","body":"### Simulations running at 60% of the theoretical Peak Performance.\r\nWe present Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations of blood and cancer cell separation in complex microfluidic channels with subcellular resolution, demonstrating unprecedented time to solution, performing at 65.5% of the available 39.4 PetaInstructions/s in the 18'688 nodes of the Titan supercomputer.\r\n\r\n### Benchmarking against the DPD GPU package of LAMMPS and HOOMD-Blue. \r\nFor a shear layer flow problem, we demonstrate an speedup of up to 45X against the GPU package of LAMMPS solvers from 27 to 18'600 nodes. We report a 4X speedup against HOOMD-Blue, in the limited range of node supported by HOOMD-Blue (up to 280 nodes).\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
